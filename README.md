A repository containing various tools I've written for Hexcasting (https://modrinth.com/mod/hex-casting).

WIP.  Copy contents into a Computercraft computer, set a focal port from Ducky's Peripherals (https://modrinth.com/mod/ducky-periphs) next to it, and run test.lua.  Edit the contents in test.xth to change the spell.
